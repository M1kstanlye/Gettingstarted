<h1> All the Good Girls go to hell</h1>

<h3>My favorite lyric</h4>
<h5>I loved the whole song. but if I had to choose which lyric vers(s) was my favorite
    I would choose the long one.</h5>

<p>  Lucifer is lonely</p>
<p>Standing there, killing time</p>
<p>Can't commit to anything but a crime</p>
<p>Peter's on vacation, an open invitation</p>
<p>Animals, evidence</p>
<p>Pearly gates look more like a picket fence</p>
<p>Once you get inside 'em</p>
<p>Got friends but can't invite them</p>
<p>Hills burn in California</p>
<p>My turn to ignore ya</p>
<p>Don't say I didn't warn ya</p>
<p>All the good girls go to hell</p>
<p>'Cause even God herself has enemies</p>
<p>And once the water starts to rise</p>
<p>And heaven's out of sight</p>
<p>She'll want the devil on her team</p>
