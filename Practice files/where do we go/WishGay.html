<h2>My favorite lyrics</h2>
<p>Baby, I don't feel so good</p>
<p>Six words you never understood</p>
<p>I'll never let you go</p>
<p>Five words you'll never say (aw)</p>
<p>I laugh alone like nothing's wrong</p>
<p>Four days has never felt so long</p>
<p>If three's a crowd and two was us</p>
<p>One slipped away</p>
