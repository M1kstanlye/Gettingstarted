<h1> All Good Girls go to hell</h1>

<h3><u>My favorite lyric</u></h3>

<p>Listen</p>
<P>Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?</p>
<p>Me to make you my art and make you a star</p>
<p>And get you connected?</p>
<p>I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected</p>
<p>But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart'Cause I'm too expensive</p>
<p>Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)</p>
<p>Calling security, keepin' my head held down</p>
<p>Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now</p>
<p>For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul</p>
<p>'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no</p>
<p>Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close</p>
<p>And I can't say no, I can't say no</p>
<p>Careful</p>
