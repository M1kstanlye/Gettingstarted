<h1> All Good Girls go to hell</h1>

<h2>My favorite lyric</h2>

<p>You said don't treat me badly</p>
<p>But you said it so sadly</p>
<p>So I did the best I could</p>
<p>Not thinking you would have left me gladly</p>
<p>I know you're not sorry</p>
<p>Why should you be</p>
<p>'Cause who am I to be in love</p>
<p>When your love never is for me</p>
<p>Me</p>
