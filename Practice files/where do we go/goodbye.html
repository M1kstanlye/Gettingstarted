<h1>Goodbye</h1>
<p>Billie's song 'goodbye' is a short song to fill in the space of her new album.
    The song is intresting and i belive it has one verse from each or everyotehr song in the album.</p>

<h2>My favorite lyric</h2>

<p>Please, please</p>
<p>Don't leave me be</p>
<p>It's not true</p>
<p>Take me to the roof</p>
<p>Told you not to worry</p>
<p>What do you want from me?</p>
<p>Don't ask questions</p>
<p>Wait a minute</p>
<p>Don't you know I'm no good for you?</p>
<p>Baby I don't feel so good</p>
<p>And all the good girls go to hell</p>
<p>Bite my tongue bide my time</p>
<p>What is it about them?</p>
<p>I'm the bad guy</p>
