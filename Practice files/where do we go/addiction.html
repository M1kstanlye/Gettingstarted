<h1>My strange addiction</h1>

<h2>My favorite lyrics</h2>
<p>I'm really, really sorry</P>
<p>I think I was just relieved to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back</p>
<p>Yeah, Michael, that movie is amazing</p>
<p>It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life</p>
<p>Deadly fever, please don't ever break</p>
<p>Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate</p>
<p>And it burns like a gin and I like it</p>
<p>Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it</p>
<p>Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it</p>
