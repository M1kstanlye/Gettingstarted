        <h2>Your opinion of Idols?</h2>
<p> Firstly, I don't consider many of this era my 'role model'. I belive I am my own Role modle.
     I do much prefer to recignize those I look up to as examples of who I can better my self as and like to recignize
     their idealistics of how to get through life.</p>

<p> One of many, who I admire and lok towards for advise, is Zendaya Colman.Who is the perfect example of a perfectionist in their finest
    and self evolver when it comes to her trade mark. Just recently she has become a major rolemodle to the youger generation of both
    Gen Z and Gen Alpha. her wokr of premoting equality, self love, and goodness took her down a long and successfull road. A
    road I hope I can take part in some time int he near future.</p>
